# Sorting Algorithms Implementation using C++
0. Selection Sort.

1. Insertion Sort.

2. Merge Sort.

3. Quick Sort.

4. Hybrid Sort.

### How to RUN
1. to Compile the Code Run "g++ -o output sort.cpp".

2. to Run Merge sort "./output 2 in/10000.txt sorted_data.txt running_time.txt". Where "2" for merge sort, 0 selection, 1 insertion, 3 quick and 5 hybrid. "in/10000.txt" is the input file directory. "sorted_data.txt" is the output file directory. "running_time.txt" file to Carry the Running time for the program.

### Analysis Code Running
Run "./performance.sh" to get analysis for the specific files in "in" directory and output files will be in "performance" directory. To get analysis for your own data, you will need to change small changes in performance.sh file.
